# Indicator Tracking

<!--Introduction-->

Indicators are defined based on the GFMU reporting needs. However, countries may request for additional metrics, including country-level disaggregations based on the D2A framework. The indicators are aligned to global fund indicator matrix where modules group them and are classified by indicator codes. Each metric has a description which provides additional information on the analysis and interpretations.

Generally the GFMU tracks indicators in three main categories; baseline, targets and Achievement values as discussed below.

* **Baseline** - Provides the base measurement of the performance indicator before the implementation of the project
activities. Its usually at the start of the reporting period. 
* **Targets** - A specific, planned level of result to be achieved within an explicit timeframe. Usually at the end of the reporting period. Targets are estimated based on the the Global Fund indicator classes.
* **Achievement** - The actual measurement achieved in the reporting period. Usually at the end of the reporting period. 

Below is an illustration of the indicator set up in Global Fund eTracker.

## Indicators

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(magrittr)
ind <- readxl::read_xlsx("./data/hiv-freq.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet3")

ind[is.na(ind)] <- ""
ind_table <- ind %>% dplyr::select(c("Module", "Code", "Name of the Indicator", "Shortname", "Indicator Class", "Description","Indicator_type","numeratorDescription","denominatorDescription"))

ind_table <- ind_table %>% dplyr::select(Code,`Name of the Indicator`,Description)

library(kableExtra)

kable(ind_table, caption = "Indicators", escape = F) %>% kable_styling()
```

## Frequency of Reporting
### HIV/TB
```{r, echo=FALSE}

hiv_freq <- readxl::read_xlsx("./data/hiv-freq.xlsx", sheet = "Sheet1")

hiv_freq[is.na(hiv_freq)] <- ""

knitr::kable(hiv_freq, caption = "HIV/TB indicators by Frequency of reporting")

```

### Malaria 
```{r echo=FALSE}

mal_freq <- readxl::read_xlsx("./data/hiv-freq.xlsx", sheet = "Mal")

mal_freq[is.na(mal_freq)] <- ""

knitr::kable(mal_freq, caption = "Malaria indicators by Frequency of reporting")
```
