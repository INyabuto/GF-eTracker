<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
This indicator is to assess the impact of antiretrovial medicine programmes on the number of children acquiring HIV by estimating the HIV transmission rate from women living with HIV to their children. The transmission can be calculated by using the Spectrum model.
</p>
<p>
In countries where data are available, facility attendance is high, and confirmatory tests are conducted systematically, efforts should be made to monitor the impact through directly assessing the percentage of children found to be HIV-positive among those born to HIV-positive mothers.
</p>
<p>
All countries should make efforts to monitor the HIV status and survival of children born to HIV-positive women, gathered during follow-up health care visits.
</p>

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
The reporting period is defined as any continuous 12-month period that has ended within a predefined number of months from the submission of the report. National reporting requirements can determine the predefined number of months. If the reporting period is 1 January to 31 December 2016, countries will calculate this indicator by using everyone who started antiretroviral therapy any time between 1 January and 31 December 2015.
</p>
<p>
Retention at 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy is defined as the outcome. Those who have died since starting therapy, those who have stopped therapy and those lost to follow-up as of month 12 (or 24, 36, 48, 60, etc.) are included in the denominator but not in the numerator. For example, people who started antiretroviral therapy between 1 January and 31 December 2014 will have reached their 12-month outcomes for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2015.
</p>
<p>
As patients start antiretroviral therapy, monthly cohort data should be collected continuously for these patients. Data for monthly cohorts that have completed at least 12 months of treatment should then be aggregated. At facility level, patients who have transferrred out will not be counted either in the numerator or denominator. Patients who have transferred in will be counted in both numerator and denominator.
</p>
<p>
Survival over longer durations of treatment provide a better picture of the long-term effectiveness of ART. If this indicator is only produced in a sub-set of facilities, comment should be added on the source of information and whether the information is representative of all ART sites.

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
The period of assessment is 12 calendar months, usually counted from January to end December, and referred to as an annual cohort. All patients registered and starting treatment during this period are included in the calculation. In sites testing with Xpert MTB/RIF® alone, the indicator can be modified to include also RR-TB cases started on a full MDR-TB treatment regimen. Only laboratory confirmed RR-TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases are counted for cohort reporting of Final Outcomes. It is measured 24 months after the end of the period of assessment. This gives sufficient time for most patients to complete their treatment and for the final culture results to be issued and recorded. All data can be extracted from the Second-line TB treatment register.
</p>
<p>
For example- Patients on a second-line drug regimen to be assessed are those who started on second-line drugs in the current calendar year minus three. Thus, if the current calendar year is 2017, the outcomes collated will be for the cohort started on second-line drugs in calendar year 2014. The report due date will be Q1 of 2018.

<p>
Refer to <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr15_online_technical_appendix.pdf">WHO TB report 2015 annex 1</a> for methods of measuring or estimating TB incidence in a given year.
</p>
<p>
In countries where the performance of TB surveillance systems do not allow the use notifications as a proxy for incidence, series of case notification rates should be carefully analyzed; and short-term forecasts may be used for planning and budgeting.
</p>
<p>
WHO recommends that all countries strengthen their surveillance systems until TB notifications are a direct measure (or close proxy) of TB incidence.
</p>
<p>
WHO also recommends that countries periodically assess TB incidence (its absolute values and trends) using a standard framework and tool for analyzing and documenting the reliability and coverage of TB notification data.

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
These indicators aim to monitor coverage of HIV prevention programs using program data and population size estimates. Where size estimations are not available, countries will be required to undertake estimation exercise as soon as possible. Until the revised estimates are provided, available estimates will be used as denominators.
</p>
<p>
Data is generated by counting people who receive a defined package of services that includes the minimum specified components- BCC; provision of consumables (condoms; lubricants, needles and syringes as needed); referral to another service such as STI diagnosis and treatment, HIV testing and counseling, etc. In addition, it could include other interventions from the comprehensive package of services.
</p>
<p>
The components of the package of HIV prevention interventions should be defined at country level and tailored to the needs of the target population. Refer to the comprehensive package of services recommended by technical partners- Tool to set and monitor targets for HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations: supplement to the 2014 consolidated guidelines for HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations. Geneva: <a href="http://www.who.int/hiv/pub/toolkits/kpp-monitoring-tools/en">World Health Organization; 2015 </a>
</p>
<p>
Data collection requires reliable tracking systems that are designed to count the number of individual “clients served” at the same service or across services as opposed to the “client visits”. This can be ensured through implementation of Unique Identification Codes (UIC). In the absence of UIC, report on the number of contacts until the time when a system to avoid double counting is set up. Agree on a timeframe for setting up such system and ensure adequate funds are available.
</p>
<p>
The coverage data from routine reporting will be triangulated with the coverage from survey data for overall impact assessment.
</p>
<p>
When targeting “other vulnerable populations” specify in the comments column of the performance framework which populations are being targeted.

<p>
The count should not include people who have stopped treatment, died or emigrated to another country or who are otherwise lost to follow-up at the facility during this period. Protocols should be in place to avoid duplicate counting of individuals across facilities or over time.
</p>
<p>
This indicator does not include antiretroviral medicines taken only for preventing mother-to-child transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis. This indicator includes pregnant women living with HIV who are receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy.
</p>
<p>
Countries should triangulate the numerator from programme data with national procurement and drug monitoring systems and adjust reported numbers as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Countries that undertake data quality assessments or reviews that monitor the extent to which facilities are able to accurately report the number of people on treatment during reporting periods should also adjust programme numerator data to account for these inconsistencies.
</p>
<p>
Estimates of coverage of antiretroviral therapy from surveys can also be used to inform or validate the numerator. Note that surveys that only capture self-reported data on treatment uptake should not be used, since self-reported data has been shown to be of limited quality.

The count should not include people who have stopped treatment, died or emigrated to another country or who are otherwise lost to follow-up at the facility during this period. Protocols should be in place to avoid duplicate counting of individuals across facilities or over time.
</p>
<p>
This indicator does not include antiretroviral medicines taken only for preventing mother-to-child transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis. This indicator includes pregnant women living with HIV who are receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy.
</p>
<p>
Countries should triangulate the numerator from programme data with national procurement and drug monitoring systems and adjust reported numbers as appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Countries that undertake data quality assessments or reviews that monitor the extent to which facilities are able to accurately report the number of people on treatment during reporting periods should also adjust programme numerator data to account for these inconsistencies.
</p>
<p>
Estimates of coverage of antiretroviral therapy from surveys can also be used to inform or validate the numerator. Note that surveys that only capture self-reported data on treatment uptake should not be used, since self-reported data has been shown to be of limited quality.
