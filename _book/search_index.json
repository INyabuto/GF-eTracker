["intro.html", "Chapter 2 Overall Description 2.1 Global Fund eTracker Perspective 2.2 Function specification", " Chapter 2 Overall Description 2.1 Global Fund eTracker Perspective Global Fund eTracker reports information from the following programs; HIV/AIDs: This includes the following modules; Comprehensive prevention program for different targets groups and PMTCT. Tuberculosis: Includes TB care and prevention, TB / HIV, MDR-TB and Treatment Care Support programs. Malaria: Includes Vector Control, HSS – Procurement and Supply Chain Management, Case management, Health Community Work Force, Specific Prevention Interventions (SPIs). Health Information Systems &amp; M&amp;E cut across all the three health areas. Data is collected in modules within the Global Fund programs through country-specific reporting tools, and then harmonized in a central database for processing and decision making by GFMU.

["data-specification.html", "Chapter 3 Data Specification 3.1 Metadata Types 3.2 Standards", " Chapter 3 Data Specification 3.1 Metadata Types Metadata are helpful to organize the different types of information collected by the Global Fund Management Unit. While other metadata may be included based on a country reporting need, the Global Fund eTracker implements the following metadata types. Table 3.1: A description of Global Fund eTracker Metadata Types Metadata Description Data elements Description Data elements forms the basis of the Global Fund eTracker. They define what is recorded in the system.GF eTracker data elements follows PSI DHIS2 standards for names and short names &amp; the GF Indicator matrix for the form names. For instance: GF HIV/AIDS - Estimated MSMs is a data element that records the estimated number of MSMs in a region. Date element groups Description Data element groups provides a mechanism for classifying Global Fund related data elements into a common theme. For instance: GF Malaria groups together all GF Malaria data elements. Data sets Description Data reporting in the Global Fund eTracker is organized through the use of the use of data sets. A data set is a collection of data elements grouped together for data collection. For instance: GF HT - HIV/AIDs is used to report data from HIV/AIDs program in Haiti (HT). Sections Description Section are used to split the Global Fund eTracker data sets into small reportable chunks known as modules. They allow for a bit more flexibility when it comes to using the tabular forms in DHIS2 and are quick and simple to design. For instance: Comprehensive prevention program for MSMs is a section within the GF HT – HIV/AIDs data set that groups together indicators to form a module Comprehensive prevention program used in the GF HIV programs. Category combos Description Category combos are used to apply Global Fund disaggregation onto the data elements and indicators.They allow multiple categories to be combined into a related set. For instance: Number of TB cases with Rifampicin-resistant (RR-TB) and/or MDR-TB notified is disaggregated according to the following categories; Sex (Female, Male) &amp; Age (&lt;15; 15+) Periods Description Global Fund eTracker supports DHIS2 standard period types to report and analyze performance over time. For instance: 201901 to report on January of 2019 or 2019Sn1 to report on the first semester of year 2019. 3.2 Standards Global Fund eTracker leverages PSI DHIS2 standards in metadata configurations and follows the principles for digital technology as the leading standard. 3.2.1 PSI DHIS2 Standards Similar to the Health Service Report (HSR), data elements are shared and can be re-used across countries. Unlike HSR, Global Fund eTracker implements country-specific data sets and uses the default sections to display forms on the data entry screen. 3.2.2 Global Fund Indicator Framework The Global Fund Indicator Framework guides the reporting and data requirements for the Global Fund eTracker. Countries may have their own specific data or disaggregtions requirements, therefore, the Global Fund eTracker implements country specific reporting tools 3.2.2.1 HIV/TB Blueprint Figure 3.1: Global Fund eTracker blueprint 3.2.2.2 Malaria Blueprint Figure 3.2: Global Fund eTracker blueprint "],
["indicator-tracking.html", "Chapter 4 Indicator Tracking 4.1 Indicators 4.2 Frequency of Reporting", " Chapter 4 Indicator Tracking Indicators are defined based on the GFMU reporting needs. However, countries may request for additional metrics, including country-level disaggregations based on the D2A framework. The indicators are aligned to global fund indicator matrix where modules group them and are classified by indicator codes. Each metric has a description which provides additional information on the analysis and interpretations. Generally the GFMU tracks indicators in three main categories; baseline, targets and Achievement values as discussed below. Baseline - Provides the base measurement of the performance indicator before the implementation of the project activities. Its usually at the start of the reporting period. Targets - A specific, planned level of result to be achieved within an explicit timeframe. Usually at the end of the reporting period. Targets are estimated based on the the Global Fund indicator classes. Achievement - The actual measurement achieved in the reporting period. Usually at the end of the reporting period. Below is an illustration of the indicator set up in Global Fund eTracker. Figure 4.1: Global Fund eTracker Indicator Analysis 4.1 Indicators Table 4.1: Indicators Code Name of the Indicator Description HIV I-6 GF - Estimated child HIV infections Description This indicator is to assess the impact of antiretrovial medicine programmes on the number of children acquiring HIV by estimating the HIV transmission rate from women living with HIV to their children. The transmission can be calculated by using the Spectrum model. In countries where data are available, facility attendance is high, and confirmatory tests are conducted systematically, efforts should be made to monitor the impact through directly assessing the percentage of children found to be HIV-positive among those born to HIV-positive mothers. All countries should make efforts to monitor the HIV status and survival of children born to HIV-positive women, gathered during follow-up health care visits. For further information refer to WHO publications on HIV monitoring and evaluation Numerator: Estimated children newly infected with HIV from mother-to-child transmission among children born in the previous 12 months to women living with HIV Denominator Estimated children delivered by women living with HIV who delivered in the previous 12 months Source Modelled (SPECTRUM MODEL) Target type Not applicable Disaggregation of reported results Not applicable References Same as in GARPR 2016 (Indicator 3.3) Worded differently in: WHO SI guide 2015- MTCT 7; Page 163- Percentage HIV-infected among HIV exposed infants born in the past 12 months Global AIDS Monitoring2017- Indicator 2.2; Page 49- Estimated percentage of children newly infected with HIV from mother-to-child transmission among women living with HIV delivering in the past 12 months HIV O-1(M) GF - HIV+ve adults and children on treatment Description The reporting period is defined as any continuous 12-month period that has ended within a predefined number of months from the submission of the report. National reporting requirements can determine the predefined number of months. If the reporting period is 1 January to 31 December 2016, countries will calculate this indicator by using everyone who started antiretroviral therapy any time between 1 January and 31 December 2015. Retention at 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy is defined as the outcome. Those who have died since starting therapy, those who have stopped therapy and those lost to follow-up as of month 12 (or 24, 36, 48, 60, etc.) are included in the denominator but not in the numerator. For example, people who started antiretroviral therapy between 1 January and 31 December 2014 will have reached their 12-month outcomes for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2015. As patients start antiretroviral therapy, monthly cohort data should be collected continuously for these patients. Data for monthly cohorts that have completed at least 12 months of treatment should then be aggregated. At facility level, patients who have transferrred out will not be counted either in the numerator or denominator. Patients who have transferred in will be counted in both numerator and denominator. Survival over longer durations of treatment provide a better picture of the long-term effectiveness of ART. If this indicator is only produced in a sub-set of facilities, comment should be added on the source of information and whether the information is representative of all ART sites.

TB O-1a GF - TB notification rate (All forms) Description It refers to all forms of TB cases that are bacteriologically confirmed or clinically diagnosed with active TB by a clinician. It includes- new and relapse cases that are; smear and/or culture positive; or smear positive/culture negative smear and/or culture negative; smear unknown/not done; Positive by WHO-recommended rapid molecular diagnostics (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF); extra-pulmonary cases confirmed by WRD; cases confirmed on the basis of X-Ray abnormalities or suggestive histology; It does not include- retreatment cases such as; treatment after failure patients; treatment after loss to follow-up (previously known as ‘treatment after default’) other retreatment cases Numerator Notified cases of all forms of TB-(i.E. Bacteriologically confirmed + clinically diagnosed) includes new and relapse cases Denominator Total Population Source TB register Target type Not applicable Disaggregation of reported results Not applicable TCP-2 (M) GF - TB Tx success rate Description Where applicable, report separately for all forms of TB cases provided with treatment in prisons, or by a specific type of health care provider or the community. This indicator is also reported as an coverage/output indicator to facilitate performance-based funding at each Progress Update and Disbursement Request (PU/DR). For further details on all forms of TB cases included under this indicator please refer to comments above (cell P14) - below: It includes- new and relapse cases that are; smear and/or culture positive; or smear positive/culture negative smear and/or culture negative; smear unknown/not done; Positive by WHO-recommended rapid molecular diagnostics (e.g. Xpert MTB/RIF); extra-pulmonary cases confirmed by WRD; cases confirmed on the basis of X-Ray abnormalities or suggestive histology; It does not include- retreatment cases such as; treatment after failure patients; treatment after loss to follow-up (previously known as ‘treatment after default’) other retreatment cases Numerator TB cases, all forms, bacteriologically confirmed plus clinically diagnosed, successfully treated (cured plus treatment completed) among all TB cases registered for treatment during, new and relapse cases Denominator Notified cases of all forms of TB-(i.E.

Disaggregated data should be reported based on routine reporting, for example, in countries with electronic reporting systems or in a sample of randomly selected districts or sites TB O-4 (M) GF - RR TB and MDR-TB Tx success rate Description The period of assessment is 12 calendar months, usually counted from January to end December, and referred to as an annual cohort. All patients registered and starting treatment during this period are included in the calculation. In sites testing with Xpert MTB/RIF® alone, the indicator can be modified to include also RR-TB cases started on a full MDR-TB treatment regimen. Only laboratory confirmed RR-TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases are counted for cohort reporting of Final Outcomes. It is measured 24 months after the end of the period of assessment. This gives sufficient time for most patients to complete their treatment and for the final culture results to be issued and recorded. All data can be extracted from the Second-line TB treatment register. For example- Patients on a second-line drug regimen to be assessed are those who started on second-line drugs in the current calendar year minus three. Thus, if the current calendar year is 2017, the outcomes collated will be for the cohort started on second-line drugs in calendar year 2014. The report due date will be Q1 of 2018. Numerator Cases with RR-TB and/or MDR-TB began second-line treatment Denominator TB cases with RR-TB and/or MDR-TB notified Source Numerator:Number of bacteriologically-confirmed XDR-TB cases enrolled on second-line anti-TB treatment who are successfully treated Denominator: Number bacteriologically-confirmed XDR-TB cases enrolled on second-line anti-TB treatment Target type Not applicable Disaggregation of reported results XDR TB TB I-2 GF - TB incidence rate Description Refer to WHO TB report 2015 annex 1 for methods of measuring or estimating TB incidence in a given year. In countries where the performance of TB surveillance systems do not allow the use notifications as a proxy for incidence, series of case notification rates should be carefully analyzed; and short-term forecasts may be used for planning and budgeting. WHO recommends that all countries strengthen their surveillance systems until TB notifications are a direct measure (or close proxy) of TB incidence. WHO also recommends that countries periodically assess TB incidence (its absolute values and trends) using a standard framework and tool for analyzing and documenting the reliability and coverage of TB notification data.

Where size estimations are not available, countries will be required to undertake estimation exercise as soon as possible. Until the revised estimates are provided, available estimates will be used as denominators. Data is generated by counting people who receive a defined package of services that includes the minimum specified components- BCC; provision of consumables (condoms; lubricants, needles and syringes as needed); referral to another service such as STI diagnosis and treatment, HIV testing and counseling, etc. In addition, it could include other interventions from the comprehensive package of services. The components of the package of HIV prevention interventions should be defined at country level and tailored to the needs of the target population. Refer to the comprehensive package of services recommended by technical partners- Tool to set and monitor targets for HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations: supplement to the 2014 consolidated guidelines for HIV prevention, diagnosis, treatment and care for key populations. Geneva: World Health Organization; 2015 Data collection requires reliable tracking systems that are designed to count the number of individual “clients served” at the same service or across services as opposed to the “client visits”. This can be ensured through implementation of Unique Identification Codes (UIC). In the absence of UIC, report on the number of contacts until the time when a system to avoid double counting is set up. Agree on a timeframe for setting up such system and ensure adequate funds are available. The coverage data from routine reporting will be triangulated with the coverage from survey data for overall impact assessment.

Protocols should be in place to avoid duplicate counting of individuals across facilities or over time. This indicator does not include antiretroviral medicines taken only for preventing mother-to-child transmission and post-exposure prophylaxis. This indicator includes pregnant women living with HIV who are receiving lifelong antiretroviral therapy. Countries should triangulate the numerator from programme data with national procurement and drug monitoring systems and adjust reported numbers as appropriate. Countries that undertake data quality assessments or reviews that monitor the extent to which facilities are able to accurately report the number of people on treatment during reporting periods should also adjust programme numerator data to account for these inconsistencies. Estimates of coverage of antiretroviral therapy from surveys can also be used to inform or validate the numerator. Note that surveys that only capture self-reported data on treatment uptake should not be used, since self-reported data has been shown to be of limited quality.

Intensified TB case finding should be implemented at all HIV care and treatment facilities and TB status of people living with HIV should be assessed at every visit during the reporting period. It is also important to monitor implementation of the entire cascade of care, starting from symptom screening to diagnosis and treatment of TB. This necessitates close coordination between the NACP and NTP but responsibility of reporting lies with the NACP Numerator PLHIV in care (including pmtct) who are screened for TB in HIV care or treatment settings Denominator PLHIV currently receiving antiretroviral therapy Source Numerator: pre-ART and ART register and cross-sectional quarterly reports Denominator: pre-ART and ART register and cross-sectional quarterly reports Target type Non cumulative (C) Disaggregation of reported results Not applicable References WHO SI guide 2015: LINK.18; page 119 A guide to monitoring and evaluation for collaborative TB/HIV activities: 2015 revision- Indicator B.1; Page 22- TB/HIV-6 (M) GF - HIV+ve new and relapse TB patients on ART Description Prompt TB treatment and early ART are critical for reducing the mortality due to HIV-associated TB and must be the highest-priority activity for both the NACP and NTP. While TB treatment should be started immediately, ART should be started within 8 weeks of TB diagnosis, given that all are eligible for ART irrespective of their CD4 cell count. Although it is important that ART status of all HIV positive TB patients is assessed, this indicator considers only new and relapse patients to avoid double counting. Cases with undocumented TB treatment history should be counted as new cases. TB and HIV programmes should aim to achieve TB treatment and ART in more than 90% of HIV positive TB patients. However, this indicator may miss patients diagnosed towards the end of reporting period whose ART treatment status may not be updated in the TB registers. Also, this indicator does not capture timeliness of ART initiation. Numerator HIV + new and relapse TB patients on art during TB treatment Denominator HIV + new and relapsed TB patients registered .

MDR-TB 3 (M)b GF - TGT RR-TB and MDR-TB cases on second-line Tx Description The programme manager is responsible to ensure that all patients in whom RR-TB or MDR-TB is detected are placed on appropriate treatment in the shortest time possible. This may also apply to patients at risk of infection with RR-TB but who are not confirmed (presumptive). Patients detected with rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) in sites using Xpert MTB/RIF to be included in the denominator as well as numerator. A comparison of enrolled to identified RR-TB/MDR-TB cases gives an indication of access to care although patients started on treatment may have been detected prior to the period of assessment. Comparator data are sourced from the Laboratory register for culture, Xpert MTB/RIF® and DST (using the date of DST result). The suggested period of assessment is six calendar months, the first usually counted from January to end June and July to end December. Indicators are measured in the month following the end of the six-month period.

Treatment for MDR-TB may take 9 months (short regimens) to 20 months or more and final outcomes can thus only be assessed one to three years after the start of enrolment. The programme manager often needs an indication of how patients are faring, well before that. This is particularly important when a drug-resistant TB treatment programme is starting. Once a program “matures,” the final outcomes become more useful to monitor. All lab confirmed RR-TB and MDR-TB patients registered and starting treatment during the period of assessment are counted for reporting of Interim Results. The denominator also includes XDR-TB cases started on prescribed treatment with second-line drugs The suggested period of assessment is six calendar months. This is usually counted from January to end June and July to end December. Indicators are measured three months after the end of the six-month period. There will be a six month timelag in reporting results from the end of a six monthly cohort.

For example, for the cohort of people on ART in 2015, one would need to wait until March 2016 to know for sure if they are on ART because if they were supposed to come in December, but they are late and come within 3 months from their appointment, they are still counted to be on ART. But in March (3 months after their Dec appointment), if they do not come, then they are counted as not on ART in Dec 2015. In Dec 2015, one would know for sure about the cohort that started in Sept 2014. The +/- 3months period allows for accommodating reporting practices that may vary from country to country- some countries report based on the Sept cohort and others try to wait until March; and some others report end Dec for the full calendar cohort, and just make assumptions that everyone is on ART (no drop out for the Nov/Dec cohort you may not have information on yet) at the time of reporting. As an EWI of HIVDR, it reflects ability of facility to attain a level of care that avoids HIVDR. Good performance is &gt;85%; passable performance is &gt;70%.
