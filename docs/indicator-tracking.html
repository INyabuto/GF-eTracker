<!--Introduction-->
<p>Indicators are defined based on the GFMU reporting needs. However, countries may request for additional metrics, including country-level disaggregations based on the D2A framework. The indicators are aligned to global fund indicator matrix where modules group them and are classified by indicator codes. Each metric has a description which provides additional information on the analysis and interpretations.</p>
<p>Generally the GFMU tracks indicators in three main categories; baseline, targets and Achievement values as discussed below.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Baseline</strong> - Provides the base measurement of the performance indicator before the implementation of the project
activities. Its usually at the start of the reporting period.</li>
<li><strong>Targets</strong> - A specific, planned level of result to be achieved within an explicit timeframe. Usually at the end of the reporting period. Targets are estimated based on the the Global Fund indicator classes.</li>
<li><strong>Achievement</strong> - The actual measurement achieved in the reporting period. Usually at the end of the reporting period.</li>
</ul>
<p>Below is an illustration of the indicator set up in Global Fund eTracker.</p>

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
This indicator is to assess the impact of antiretrovial medicine programmes on the number of children acquiring HIV by estimating the HIV transmission rate from women living with HIV to their children. The transmission can be calculated by using the Spectrum model.
</p>
<p>
In countries where data are available, facility attendance is high, and confirmatory tests are conducted systematically, efforts should be made to monitor the impact through directly assessing the percentage of children found to be HIV-positive among those born to HIV-positive mothers.
</p>
<p>
All countries should make efforts to monitor the HIV status and survival of children born to HIV-positive women, gathered during follow-up health care visits.
</p>

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
The reporting period is defined as any continuous 12-month period that has ended within a predefined number of months from the submission of the report. National reporting requirements can determine the predefined number of months. If the reporting period is 1 January to 31 December 2016, countries will calculate this indicator by using everyone who started antiretroviral therapy any time between 1 January and 31 December 2015.
</p>
<p>
Retention at 12 months after starting antiretroviral therapy is defined as the outcome. Those who have died since starting therapy, those who have stopped therapy and those lost to follow-up as of month 12 (or 24, 36, 48, 60, etc.) are included in the denominator but not in the numerator. For example, people who started antiretroviral therapy between 1 January and 31 December 2014 will have reached their 12-month outcomes for the reporting period 1 January to 31 December 2015.
</p>
<p>
As patients start antiretroviral therapy, monthly cohort data should be collected continuously for these patients. Data for monthly cohorts that have completed at least 12 months of treatment should then be aggregated. At facility level, patients who have transferrred out will not be counted either in the numerator or denominator. Patients who have transferred in will be counted in both numerator and denominator.
</p>
<p>
Survival over longer durations of treatment provide a better picture of the long-term effectiveness of ART. If this indicator is only produced in a sub-set of facilities, comment should be added on the source of information and whether the information is representative of all ART sites.

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
The period of assessment is 12 calendar months, usually counted from January to end December, and referred to as an annual cohort. All patients registered and starting treatment during this period are included in the calculation. In sites testing with Xpert MTB/RIF® alone, the indicator can be modified to include also RR-TB cases started on a full MDR-TB treatment regimen. Only laboratory confirmed RR-TB, MDR-TB and XDR-TB cases are counted for cohort reporting of Final Outcomes. It is measured 24 months after the end of the period of assessment. This gives sufficient time for most patients to complete their treatment and for the final culture results to be issued and recorded. All data can be extracted from the Second-line TB treatment register.
</p>
<p>
For example- Patients on a second-line drug regimen to be assessed are those who started on second-line drugs in the current calendar year minus three. Thus, if the current calendar year is 2017, the outcomes collated will be for the cohort started on second-line drugs in calendar year 2014. The report due date will be Q1 of 2018.

<p>
Refer to <a href="http://www.who.int/tb/publications/global_report/gtbr15_online_technical_appendix.pdf">WHO TB report 2015 annex 1</a> for methods of measuring or estimating TB incidence in a given year.
</p>
<p>
In countries where the performance of TB surveillance systems do not allow the use notifications as a proxy for incidence, series of case notification rates should be carefully analyzed; and short-term forecasts may be used for planning and budgeting.
</p>
<p>
WHO recommends that all countries strengthen their surveillance systems until TB notifications are a direct measure (or close proxy) of TB incidence.
</p>
<p>
WHO also recommends that countries periodically assess TB incidence (its absolute values and trends) using a standard framework and tool for analyzing and documenting the reliability and coverage of TB notification data.

<p>
These indicators aim to monitor coverage of HIV prevention programs using program data and population size estimates. Where size estimations are not available, countries will be required to undertake estimation exercise as soon as possible. Until the revised estimates are provided, available estimates will be used as denominators.
</p>
<p>
Data is generated by counting people who receive a defined package of services that includes the minimum specified components- BCC; provision of consumables (condoms; lubricants, needles and syringes as needed); referral to another service such as STI diagnosis and treatment, HIV testing and counseling, etc. In addition, it could include other interventions from the comprehensive package of services.
</p>
<p>

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
These indicators aim to monitor coverage of HIV prevention programs using program data and population size estimates. Where size estimations are not available, countries will be required to undertake estimation exercise as soon as possible. Until the revised estimates are provided, available estimates will be used as denominators.
</p>
<p>
Data is generated by counting people who receive a defined package of services that includes the minimum specified components- BCC; provision of consumables (condoms; lubricants, needles and syringes as needed); referral to another service such as STI diagnosis and treatment, HIV testing and counseling, etc. In addition, it could include other interventions from the comprehensive package of services.

<p>
Intensified TB case finding should be implemented at all HIV care and treatment facilities and TB status of people living with HIV should be assessed at every visit during the reporting period. It is also important to monitor implementation of the entire cascade of care, starting from symptom screening to diagnosis and treatment of TB. This necessitates close coordination between the NACP and NTP but responsibility of reporting lies with the NACP

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Prompt TB treatment and early ART are critical for reducing the mortality due to HIV-associated TB and must be the highest-priority activity for both the NACP and NTP. While TB treatment should be started immediately, ART should be started within 8 weeks of TB diagnosis, given that all are eligible for ART irrespective of their CD4 cell count.
</p>
<p>
Although it is important that ART status of all HIV positive TB patients is assessed, this indicator considers only new and relapse patients to avoid double counting. Cases with undocumented TB treatment history should be counted as new cases.
</p>
<p>
TB and HIV programmes should aim to achieve TB treatment and ART in more than 90% of HIV positive TB patients. However, this indicator may miss patients diagnosed towards the end of reporting period whose ART treatment status may not be updated in the TB registers. Also, this indicator does not capture timeliness of ART initiation.

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
The programme manager is responsible to ensure that all patients in whom RR-TB or MDR-TB is detected are placed on appropriate treatment in the shortest time possible. This may also apply to patients at risk of infection with RR-TB but who are not confirmed (presumptive).
</p>
<p>
Patients detected with rifampicin-resistant TB (RR-TB) in sites using Xpert MTB/RIF to be included in the denominator as well as numerator.
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p>
A comparison of enrolled to identified RR-TB/MDR-TB cases gives an indication of access to care although patients started on treatment may have been detected prior to the period of assessment. Comparator data are sourced from the Laboratory register for culture, Xpert MTB/RIF® and DST (using the date of DST result).
</p>
<p>
The suggested period of assessment is six calendar months, the first usually counted from January to end June and July to end December. Indicators are measured in the month following the end of the six-month period.

<h3>
Description
</h3>
<p>
Patients with rifampicin- resistant TB (RR-TB) in sites using Xpert MTB/ RIF who are on treatment to be included in the denominator as well as numerator
Lost to follow up refers to treatment interruption for two or more consecutive months for any reason without medical approval.
</p>
<p>
Treatment for MDR-TB may take 9 months (short regimens) to 20 months or more and final outcomes can thus only be assessed one to three years after the start of enrolment. The programme manager often needs an indication of how patients are faring, well before that. This is particularly important when a drug-resistant TB treatment programme is starting. Once a program “matures,” the final outcomes become more useful to monitor.
</p>
<p>
All lab confirmed RR-TB and MDR-TB patients registered and starting treatment during the period of assessment are counted for reporting of Interim Results. The denominator also includes XDR-TB cases started on prescribed treatment with second-line drugs
The suggested period of assessment is six calendar months. This is usually counted from January to end June and July to end December. Indicators are measured three months after the end of the six-month period. There will be a six month timelag in reporting results from the end of a six monthly cohort.

Description

<p>
The +/- 3 months allows to know if someone is still “on ART”. For example, for the cohort of people on ART in 2015, one would need to wait until March 2016 to know for sure if they are on ART because if they were supposed to come in December, but they are late and come within 3 months from their appointment, they are still counted to be on ART. But in March (3 months after their Dec appointment), if they do not come, then they are counted as not on ART in Dec 2015. In Dec 2015, one would know for sure about the cohort that started in Sept 2014. The +/- 3months period allows for accommodating reporting practices that may vary from country to country- some countries report based on the Sept cohort and others try to wait until March; and some others report end Dec for the full calendar cohort, and just make assumptions that everyone is on ART (no drop out for the Nov/Dec cohort you may not have information on yet) at the time of reporting.
